        THE BACKGROUND OF NAMANATTU KUMDUMBA KSHETHRAM:
        
</h5>
<p>
Namanattu Kudumbam (Namanattu family) is a very ancient family. It is situated near to A.K.G. Junction, 
Parayakadu, Kuthiathod Village, Cherthala Taluk, Alappuzha District, in the State of Kerala. According 
to the available information, the Namanattu family had got old age of decades in a Survey conducted 100 
years back. The present generation adores the deities which were kept and adored by the ancient generations
 of Namanattu family. 

The 18½ plot properties (18½ Muri Purayidam) extending from the southern boundary of the Namanattu Kudumba Kshethram Property to the Kannattu Hospital at Nalukulangara, were owned by Namanattu Family. Subsequently, before the period of past 3 generations, it was subjected to civil cases and it was decreed in favour of the Namanattu Family. But unfortunately, the above said properties could not be executed by the legal proceedings in their favour due to lack of persons in the Namanattu family, and thereby the entire properties were alienated forever, Therefore, the properties of the Namanattu family were remained to the extent of the properties wherein the Kudumba Kshethram situates and the properties wherein the other Issues were resided.

Aiswarya Gandharwan and Aiswharya Yakshi were existed in the underground sanctum-sanctorum (Nilavara) of the Namanattu family. Kodgungallur Devi and Naga Devathas (Serpent deities) were situated as situated in the respective places of the family at present. The ancient house including the underground sanctum-sanctorum (Nilavara) was demolished for constructing new house, during the period of 1970s by Shri.K.Ramankunju who had retired from the Kerala Police Service as Dy.S.P.  But there was no arrangement done for providing Aiswarya Gandharwa-Yakshi who were existed in the underground sanctum-sanctorum (Nilavara). Only after long delay only, a new temple was constructed and Aiswarya Gandharwan and Gandharwa Yakshi were installed therein. Despite the fact that the sanctum-sanctorum (Nilavara) was demolished and as there were no alternate arrangements to provide them therein, they did not leave Namanattu family, which clearly exposes their kindness to Namanattu Family. </p>

<h5>THE GRACE OF NAMANATTU PARADEVATHAS:</h5>
<p>
Namanattu family deities are very powerful in the matter of blessings. They would bless their extreme, 
if utmost prayers are being offered before them. A girl, who was married to one of the members of Namanattu 
family, had no Issues even after a long time. She prayed before the Sanctum Sanctorum of Aishwarya Gandharwan
 and Aishwarya Yakshmiyamma, to the effect that she would present a Lamp (Nilavilakku) before them, if she was
  graced with a kid. She accordingly presented the Lamp (Nilavilakku) before Aishwarya Gandharwan and
   Yakshmiyamma, as she prayed for, before pregnancy. But she had not borne issue even after the presentation
    of Nilavilakku. Thereafter, she did not come to the Namanattu Kudumba Kshethram with disappointment. When 
    somebody enquired her with regard to her absence in the Kudumba Kshethram, she replied that she would come 
    to the Kudumba Kshethram only after she is being blessed with a kid. Within a reasonable period, she 
    consumed and thereafter delivered a cute girl. Thereafter she brought her kid to the Kudumba Kshethram and 
    prayed before them. Now itself she continues her prayer. </p>
<p>
Now-a-days, a devotee reached the Kudumba Kshethram when the Kalamezhuthum Pattum was functioning and the 
deity Gurunadhan was blessed with a man. The devotee submitted before the deity Gurunadhan that his 
daughter-in-law has no issues and prayed for blessings. Gurunadhan Swami replied to enlight lamps for 
12 weeks in the Kudumba Kshethram. Accordingly they enlighted lamps for 12 weeks, and before completing 
12 weeks enlightenment, the above said daughter-in-law, became consumed with the grace of the deities of 
Namanattu Kudumba Kshethram. According to the available knowledge, so many persons have obtained jobs and 
arrangement of marriage by the grace of the deities in the Namanattu Kudumba Kshethram.

<h5>
GOVERNMENT’S FINANCIAL AID:
</h5>
<p>
The Namanattu Kudumba Kshethram was granted financial aid by the Government which was financed by WHO 
(World Health Organisation) as part of having maintained small Forest (Kavu) and Serpent pond (Sarpakulam). 
It is recognition so far as the Namanattu Kudumba Kshethram is concerned.</p>
<p>
One of the blessings received by Namanattu Kudumbam that, one of the ancestors of Namanattu Kudumbam 
became Sanyasi (to live as a monk) and he reached Nalukulangara Devi temple after he was wandering different 
places and he was sitting under the Banyan (Almaram) tree near to the temple. Subsequently all on a sudden, 
he ran towards northern side getting knowledge (Velipadu). He reached on the southern side of AKG Junction 
and on the western side of the Cherthala-Kumbalangi road and entered into the then forest therein (now this 
place is under the possession and ownership of the children of Dr.Sugunandan). After a long meditation, he 
took away a deity there from to Nalukulangara temple and subsequently the above said Deity is known as 
Balasaraswathy (Bala Bhadra). This was revealed in the Astamangala Prashnam (conducting astrology by more 
than one or two astrologers) and directed the Namanattu family members to conduct special poojas to 
Balasaraswathy Devi. Therefore, the members of Namanattu Kudumbam used to particularly perform poojas to 
Balasaraswathy Devi in their particular situations. It has to be remembered that two members of Namanattu 
Kudumbam were graced to have served as Director Board members of the Nalukulangara Devaswom wherein 
Balasaraswathy Devi is situated.

<h5>
THAZHUPPU SIVAPURAM TEMPLE AND NAMANATTU KUDUMBA KSHETHRAM:
</h5>
<p>
One of the members in the last generation of Namanattu Kudumbam, viz., late.N.K.Bhaskaran had conducted 
business on the western side of Cherthala-Kumbalangi road. He had kept an idol of Shree Dharmasastha in 
the form of sitting as Pulivahana (Shree Dharmasastha sitting on panther as a vehicle). The inhabitants of 
the place Thazhuppu which lies on the eastern side of the lake lying on the eastern side of Namanattu Kudumbam, 
used to visit Sabarimala temple on the first day of Malayalam month of Dhanuvam every year (now itself it 
continues as such) from the Sivapuram temple situated at Thazhuppu.  During that time, the above said 
inhabitants of Thazhuppu came to late.N.K.Bhasakaran to have the idol kept by him, for prayer at the time of 
leaving for Sabarimala Temple. Even if they had promised that they would return the idol to late.Bhaskaran 
after their prayers, they have not done so and subsequently, it was installed for performing poojas in the 
temple. This fact was exposed in the Astamangala Prashnam (conducting astrology by more than one or two 
astrologers). It was particularly exposed that the members of the Namanattu Kudumbam are not reaching or 
caring the Shree Dharmasastha in the Thazhuppu Sivapuram temple to where the idol was taken away from 
late.N.K.Bhaskaran. It was also revealed in the Astamangala Prashnam (conducting astrology by more than 
one astrologer) that the members in the Namanattu Kudumbam have to conduct prayers and submit coins to 
Shree Darmasastha after placing the same to the bodies of each members by enlightening Nilavilakku (Lamp) 
and placing red pattu (red cloth) as Prayaschitham (apology). Therefore, the members of Namanattu Kudumbam 
used to do the same on the first day of every Malayalam month of Dhanuvam as prayaschitham (apology) to  
Shree Dharma Sastha in the Sivapuram temple, Now it is a divine practice so far as the members of Namanattu 
family are concerned,
